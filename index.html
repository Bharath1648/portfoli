      <h2>My Experiences</h2>
      <h3>Research center imarat(DRDO)</h3>
      <p>
          During my internship at RCI_DRDO as a Frontend Developer, I had the opportunity to contribute to impactful projects and enhance my skills in web development. The following summarizes my key responsibilities and achievements:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement user interfaces for defense-related applications.</li>
          <li>Utilized modern frontend technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces.</li>
          <li>Worked on optimizing web applications for performance and usability.</li>
          <li>Engaged in the full software development lifecycle, from concept and design to testing and deployment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          The experience at DRDO not only deepened my technical skills but also provided insights into the application of technology in the defense sector. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to such meaningful projects.
